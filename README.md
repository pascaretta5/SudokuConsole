# SudokuConsole
That's a project from University but also personal, which I've developed a Sudoku game playable via console.
I will keep improving and updating within time.
I hope I can also help some other students and professionals in the field.
Thanks.

# COMPILE:

1. Inside the main class, that will be a method called "game()" with a green arrow at the left (if you use IntelliJ Idea).
2. After finding the Green arrow, click it.
3. Then, the game will be generated and ready to play.
# AFTER COMPILE:
Sudoku is a logic game played on a 9x9 grid using the digits 1 through 9. This grid is further subdivided into nine 3x3 boxes. The goal is to fill in the grid with digits such that one and only one of each digit 1 through 9 appear in every row, column, and box.
In order to place the numbers, just fill in the coordinates given in the grid.


----- Have fun! -----
